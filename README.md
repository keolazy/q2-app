**ReadMe is a simple proof-of-concept app that mashes up professional event discovery (a la EventBrite) with discrete social matching (similar to Tinder, Bumble, etc., but _meant for connections_ and not for dating)**. The goal is to make professional networking -- a milieu that is often superficial and awkward -- more deep, sincere, and meaningful.

ReadMe was built by a small team, over the course of 1 week, as a self-directed midterm project in the Galvanize Web Development Immersive course.

The app is deployed at: https://readme-app.herokuapp.com (this is a free Heroku setup so you may need to wait several seconds for app startup).
You can login as barackobama@yahoo.com / pw: 'barack'.

Here's a brief walkthrough showing login, browsing, making social connections:

I've also written my own making-of [on my blog](https://medium.com/@ianschum/readme-a-simple-social-media-app-built-with-node-postgres-and-ejs-b95de9ece408).
